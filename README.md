=================

So, have you ever been in bed using your iPhone, and you tap on a text field 
only to find that your bluetooth keyboard is still connected and you have to 
walk _all the way across the room_ to press the eject key and show the keyboard?
Well, this tweak is for you. Assign this to some activator action and voila, show
or hide your keyboard with a simple Activator action.

# Dependencies #
Relies on: libactivator, libsubstrate. Clone and run make to automatically 
initialize the submodules and do all the hard work there.
